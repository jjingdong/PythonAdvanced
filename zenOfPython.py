'''
Beautiful is better than ugly
explicit is better than implicit
simple is better than complex
complex is better than complicated
flat is better than nested
sparse is better than dense
readability counts
special cases aren't special enought to break the rules
although practicality beats purity
errors should never pass silently
unless explicityly silenced
in the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess
there should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it
although that way maybe be obvious at irst unless you're Dutch
Now is better than never
although never is often better than *right* now
if the implementatation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
if the implementation is easy to explain, it maybe a good idea
numspaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
